## Overview
This project contains:
1. An implementation of homebrew dmr protocol (which is used by brandmeister and hblink). Not yet complete, but sufficient for #2 and #3.
1. Decoding UDP proxy
1. Basic private dmr master server

### Installation
1. Check basic requirements:
    - Linux or Windows
    - Python 3.11+
1. Clone/download the repo.
1. Create environment and install requirements (linux example):
```
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
Copy `localmaster_EXAMPLE.py` to `localmaster.py` and edit.

### Run
```
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ python localmaster.py
```
`Ctrl+C` to break and stop.

The running server listens for `62031/udp` as DMR service (may be changed with `--port` command line argument)
and exposes http API/dashboard on `8000/tcp` (may be changed with `--web-port` command line argument):
- API: http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8000/api/dashboard
- Web dashboard: http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8000/dashboard/index.html

## Roadmap
### What is this for (general TODO)
- Private dmr network (own registration, admintool, dashboard, voice apps, etc)
- Other dmr networks bridge (configurable group/unit routing rules, ID replacements, etc)
- Bridge/proxy with packet modification (substitute IDs, add TA, etc..)
- Voice robots interface at packet level (parrot for group and unit cals, recording/playback as prewritten packets by events)
- Encoding and decoding of AMBE (allows to build advanced voice services, like voice time, agenda, etc)
- Voice call history dump (ambe files or decoded)


### Features & TODO
- ‚úîÔ∏è basic apps support
- ‚úîÔ∏è parrot
- ‚úîÔ∏è password check
- ‚úîÔ∏è fastapi api
- ‚úîÔ∏è web dashboard
- ‚úîÔ∏è unit call routing
- ‚úîÔ∏è allow single peer id check
- ‚úîÔ∏è TA support (DMRA packet)
- ‚úîÔ∏è dmr internal structure decoding (get LC, voice data)
- ü•ï routing (1 timeslot == 1 routing entity)
- ü•ï only one call per ts for peer (per routing entity)
- ü•ï dmr internal structure encoding (set LC, generate voice data)
- ü•ï apps unit call routing (routing entity for app)
- ü•ï configuration
- ü•ï users configuration (allowed id and passes per id)
- ü•ï resolve id to callsigns
- ü•ï routing 2: group subscriptions
- ü•ï data calls (messages)
- ü•ï ambe decode/encode
- ü•ï log voice calls as files
- ü•ï TA support 2 (inside DMRD packets)
- ü•ï registration
- ü•ï update radiod list and resolve
